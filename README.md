Hey there! 👋 I'm a Python enthusiast with a passion for full-stack development. 🚀 I love learning new things every day, and I'm always exploring new technologies to improve my skills and grow as a developer. 🌱

About Me
🐍 Python is my go-to language, but I also dabble in full-stack development (front-end, back-end, and everything in between!).
💻 I've worked as a full-stack intern, where I had the opportunity to develop applications.
📚 I believe in constant learning, and I’m always up for a new challenge to sharpen my coding abilities.
